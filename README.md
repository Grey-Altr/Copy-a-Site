# Copy-a-Site

You should pick a website and copy its HTML structure, layout and styling (focus mostly on the layout here). When submitting, be sure to include a link to your Github Pull Request which should have Netlify deploy previews enabled. Your submission should also have a link to the site whose layout you're mimicking. Use this template as a starting point: https://github.com/alchemycodelab/web-template
